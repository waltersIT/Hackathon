          "topic": "Escrow Mismatch",
          "explanation": "An escrow mismatch occurs when the escrow amount and the security deposit amount on a portfolio do not match. This typically happens during a tenant move-in or move-out process. It can occur when a tenant makes a payment incorrectly or when a property manager refunds a tenant without completing a corresponding bank transfer. The escrow account should always mirror the security deposit balance for accurate reporting.",
          "examples": [
            "Tenant selects 'Make a Payment' instead of 'Pay Deposit', depositing all funds into the trust account instead of the security deposit account.",
            "During move-out, a property manager refunds a tenant from the trust account but forgets to record a matching transfer between trust and escrow accounts.",
            "Tenant paid deposit funds into the operating trust account instead of the escrow account, causing a portfolio diagnostic mismatch."
          ],
          "solution": "If the security deposit is greater than the escrow amount, transfer funds from the trust account to the security deposit account. If the security deposit is less, transfer funds from the security deposit account to the trust account. In Rentvine, go to Accounting > Banking > Pending Transfers to record or manually create the transfer. Also confirm the transfer is done in real life between the corresponding bank accounts.",

          "topic": "Security Deposits",
          "explanation": "Rentvine tracks two key bank accounts for property managers: the Trust account and the Escrow account. The Escrow account holds tenant security deposits. The escrow balance should always match the total security deposits on the portfolio ledger. Discrepancies here create an escrow mismatch that must be corrected by verifying where the funds were received and performing a bank transfer as needed.",
          "examples": [
            "Tenant selects 'Make a Payment' instead of 'Pay Deposit', causing the receipt to deposit into the Trust account instead of Escrow.",
            "Security deposit applied to repairs or charges during move-out without transferring the funds between accounts."
          ],
          "solution": "To resolve an escrow mismatch, navigate to Accounting > Banking > Actions > New Bank Transfer. Select the accounts based on the posting settings in the portfolio ledger. After recording the transfer in Rentvine, ensure that the actual bank transfer is completed outside the system as well. For move-outs or refunds, use the lease\u2019s Green Actions menu to 'Move Out', 'Release Deposit', or 'Refund'.",

          "topic": "Suppressed Fee Mismatch",
          "explanation": "A suppressed fee mismatch happens when fees that should have been charged to or collected from an owner are out of balance due to suppressed general ledger (GL) codes. These mismatches can be positive or negative and typically arise during post-management fee cycles, tenant reapplications, or owner offboarding.",
          "examples": [
            "Positive mismatch: Tenant paid a suppressed fee, but the owner has not yet been billed for it.",
            "Negative mismatch: Owner was billed or charged for a suppressed fee that was later unallocated, causing the system to show that the property manager owes money to the owner.",
            "An offboarded owner still shows unpaid suppressed fees in Diagnostics due to missed manual correction."
          ],
          "solution": "For positive mismatches, create or pay the missing bill by going to Accounting > Manager > Post Management Fees and billing the suppressed fee. For older mismatches, add a bill manually via Accounting > Money Out > Add Bill and pay it using the same GL code from Diagnostics. For negative mismatches, either transfer funds from the business operating account to the trust account and record an 'Other Receipt', or issue a vendor credit for the next billing cycle. For offboarded owners, use journal entries to reclassify balances between the suppressed GL and owner distribution or management fee expense accounts as appropriate.",
          "best_practices": [
            "Review the Diagnostics tab frequently to identify mismatches early before closing a month or owner account.",
            "During offboarding, ensure suppressed fee mismatches are cleared before deactivating the owner\u2019s portfolio.",

In 'Money Out', review the Invoices tab for uploaded invoices that need to be converted to bills or rejected. Payments made by check or 'Other' can be voided; ACH payments cannot be voided once settled. Settlement status can be viewed by selecting 'View Settlement'.

          "solution": "To correct management fee setup, navigate to Property > Settings > Management Fees. Adjust the chart of account toggles for suppression. Perform a 'Master Reset' by reapplying the receipt, editing the charge to a temporary COA, saving, reverting to the correct suppressed COA, and then reapplying the receipt again. This ensures the management fee recalculates and applies correctly.",
